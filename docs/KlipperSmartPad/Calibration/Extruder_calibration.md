# 2.1 Extruder calibration


The configuration files I use are configured for my hardware. You
settings for your extruder.
Start by heating your nozzle to 220Â°C from the control panel.

If you have 2 extruders, use the macro to select the correct extruder.
T0 for extruder 1 and T1 for extruder 2. Pay attention to the Y of the head at the
filament crossing.
At console level, run the following commands:
`M83` to reset the extruder
```
M83
```
Mark your filament with a marker 10 cm and 12 cm from the extruder.
extruder.
The aim is to ask the extruder to draw 10cm and check that the correct
length has been drawn.
Once you're ready, run the command:
```
G1 E100 F200
```
Check that 10cm has been extruded.

If this is the case, nothing to do.
Otherwise, you'll need to change a parameter in your configuration file. The
parameter to change is in printer.cfg.
Look in the extruder section and find the value rotation_distance.
For extruder 1, it's in the `[extruder]` section.
For extruder 2, it's in the `[belted_extruder]` section.

The value entered must be replaced by the correct value.
To find the correct value, use the following formula:
`("measured distance in mm" / "requested distance in mm") X "rotation_distance"`

Example:
I had `9cm` extruded and not `10cm`
The current value of rotation_distance is `7.805`
The formula will therefore be `("90" / "100") X "7.805" = 7.0245`
The new value will be `7.0245`
Click on SAVE and RESTART in the top right-hand corner to
to save the file.
Now your SpeederPad/Raspberry and printer are ready to print.
You can slice a 3d model and import it into the G-Code File section.
You can now start printing from the Mainsail interface or from the
touch screen.
